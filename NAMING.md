# Naming rules for PSO2 Utility modules

Every module name MUST satisfy the naming rules below:
- Avoid existing name, reserved words for PSO2 Utility, node.js, JavaScript, HTML
- The name can only contains `[0-9][a-z][A-Z]` and the first letter must be `[a-z][A-Z]_`

For anything that belongs to a part of the module, naming rules MUST satisfy for the name ADDITIONALLY:
- A prefix of its own module name with a underscore, for example: A class Links_Link for Links module
